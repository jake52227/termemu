# termemu

This is a practice project that I took on for learning about terminal emulators, C++ and OpenGL. It's very unfinished.

# About

"termemu" (creative name) is going to be a hardware accelerated terminal emulator. Components and tools used in the project include:
- Meson: a build system. Can be found at https://mesonbuild.com/
- OpenGL
- GLFW: OpenGL library. Can be found at https://www.glfw.org/
- GLAD: a loader-generator for OpenGL. Can be found at https://glad.dav1d.de/

The project is made for Linux.
