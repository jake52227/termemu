# termemu

This is a practice project that I took on for learning about terminal emulators, C++ and OpenGL. It's very unfinished.

# About

"termemu" (creative name) is going to be a hardware accelerated terminal emulator. Components and tools used in the project include:
- Meson: a build system. https://mesonbuild.com/
- OpenGL
- GLFW: OpenGL library. https://www.glfw.org/
- GLAD: a loader-generator for OpenGL. https://glad.dav1d.de/
- GLM: OpenGL mathematics. https://github.com/g-truc/glm 

The project is made for Linux.
